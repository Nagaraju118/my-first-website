            <p style="text-align: left;">The most worshipped and remembered demi God — especially in time of trouble or danger — is Lord Hanuman. It is quite normal for a Hindu, howsoever educated he or she may be — to invoke the name of Hanuman whenever in distress, and offer prasad to the deity as soon as the danger or fear has passed.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left;">Hanumanji has never claimed to be a God, but calls himself the most faithful and devoted servant of Ram, an avtar of Vishnu in the ‘Treta Yug’. Hanumanji, as He is lovingly called by all Hindus, is not even supposed to be a human being, but a monkey who met Ram and Laxman while they were searching for Sita — the wife of Ram who had been kidnapped by Ravan, the King of Sri Lanka</p>
